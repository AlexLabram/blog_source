It's Christmas day and I'm happily ensconced at my parents' home awaiting the turkey dinner.  I've got a small pile of gift - books, chocolate and random oddities - but rather than enjoying them... I'm trying to translate a Japanese flyer that came with a package from some Tokyo-based family friends.  This is the adult equivalent of children ignoring the present and playing with the box it came in.

I've been trying to learn Japanese on and off since I was fifteen and a purple belt at karate.  The physical fitness and coordination is lost in the mists of time, but the urge to understand what "mawashigeri jodan" actually means[^1] never quite died away.  My interest kinda bubbled away for a decade, without any consistent progress, but I actually managed to get into a decent study routine from about mid-2019... up until COVID.  Dammit, COVID.

Anyway, I've learned the hard way that, once you start googling ideograms, you don't stop.  In particular, I stumbled across a useful reference: a [Quora post](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-common-Japanese-verbs/answer/Marcus-Ford) listing some of the most commonly used verbs.  This blog post expands on that list, providing some context that I found useful.

## Japanese Grammar 101

If you're mostly familiar with European languages, Japanese is a shock to the system.  There are the obvious differences: where we use an alphabet of 26 characters, they use forty-six characters... for each of two syllablistic alphabets (hiragana and katakana)... plus [diacritical marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakuten_and_handakuten) and [subscripts](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/why-is-the-hiragana-tiny-how-to-use-%E3%82%83-%E3%82%85-%E3%82%87-and-%E3%81%A3/)... and fifty thousand ideograms (kanji) lurking in the background.

But this is really just the tip of the iceberg of weirdness.  The word order is typically different, subject / object / verb rather than subject / verb / object... but it would be more accurate to say that Japanese has a completely different relationship with word order than e.g. English.  Basically, sentences in European languages can be seen as a series of boxes into which sentence components are slotted, with the position of the word being critical to its role.  Sentences in Japanese are better viewed as a series of Lego blocks glued together by connector words called particles, which add flavour and explicitly mark the sentence part.  I'll do another post on this at some point.

An extra level of complexity comes from the etymology of words: some descend from archaic Japanese, whilst some came over from mainland China during various waves of immigration and trade.  Typically, native words tend to be more fluid whilst Chinese loan words tend to be pithier (presumably because the original [tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese_phonology#Tones) have been filed off): consider "muzukashii" vs "taihen", for example.  Chinese loan words also make heavier use of diacritical marks, and are associated with an entirely different set of kanji pronunciations: the "on" soundings as opposed to the native "kun" soundings.

In the words of my generation (of maths grads): [bozhe moi](https://youtu.be/gXlfXirQF3A).

## Verbs in particular

In Japanese, the line between verbs and other sentence parts is not always trivial.  There are three points of divergence in particular:

1. The existence of "copulas" (Latin: connecting word).  It's horribly naive and simplistic to call these things verbs... but they're basically verbs.  Or, rather, conjugations of one pseudo-verb, "desu".  After considerable googling, I've settled on thinking of this as the null verb: it's a catch-all you can use when the sentence needs a verb for completeness but you don't actually want it to convey any meaning.
2. The family of "suru verbs" (i.e. compound verbs of the form "X suru", where "suru" is the verb for "to do").  For example "benkyou", a noun meaning "study" or "diligence",can be used in the form "benkyou suru" to describe the action of studying,
3. One interpretation I've just stumbled across says that a lot of Japanese adjectives are technically [stative verbs](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2020/09/stative-verbs.html).  Oy vey.

The list below ignores verbs in the categories #2 and #3, but includes the copula as item 0.

Within the slightly-less-weird verbs I'm including in the list, there are two further distinctions.  Firstly, how the word conjugates:

1. Irregular verbs.  There are only two of these: "suru" (to do) and "kuru" (to come).
2. Ichidan ("one-step") verbs all end in "ru".  They are conjugated by carving off the final syllable and replacing it by something else - for example "taberu" (to eat) becomes "tabemashita" (to have eaten).  They are "one-step" in the sense that the final hiragana character prior to the suffix stays the same after conjugation - e.g. "be" for "taberu".
3. Godan ("five-step") verbs all end with the sound "u", but this can be part of any syllable (e.g. "matsu" - "to wait" - ends with the hiragana "tsu").  These are "five-step" because the final syllable before the suffix can be anything from the same row of the hiragana chart (e.g. "ta", "chi", "tsu", "te", "to").
4. ...There are also godan verbs that just happen to end in "ru", because of course there are.  This leads to a couple of fun situations:
    + "kiru" ("to wear") is ichidan, whilst "kiru" ("to cut") is godan.  So the basic words are indistinguishable, at least in hiragana, but the polite forms are "kimasu" and "kirimasu" respectively.
    + Remember I said "kuru" (to come) was irregular?  *Its* polite form is "kimasu".  Wait a second...

For extra fun, a lot of beginner Japanese textbooks ([cough](https://www.amazon.co.uk/TRY-%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E8%83%BD%E5%8A%9B%E8%A9%A6%E9%A8%93-N5-%E6%96%87%E6%B3%95%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E4%BC%B8%E3%81%B0%E3%81%99%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E-%E6%94%B9%E8%A8%82%E7%89%88/dp/4872179005)) refer to godan verbs as "Class 1" and ichidan verbs as "Class 2" (despite ichi meaning... y'know... one).  This is because godan conjugation is really the baseline behaviour; it's just that there was a large enough pile of "ru" verbs that shrinking most of them down by one syllable was an attractive option.

There's a handy [verb conjugator](http://www.japaneseverbconjugator.com/) online that will do some but not all of the work.  (I keep finding new conjugations that it doesn't yet cover!)

Secondly, I'm going to draw a slightly fluffy distinction between action verbs, which are typically used directly to describe what is happening, and structural verbs, which are typically used to construct more complicated sentences.  This is entirely personal terminology: I find it useful to distinguish between words I'm learning because they have more precise connotations and words I'm learning because they can stitch other concepts together in ever more intricate ways.  Some verbs don't fall cleanly into either category, or have different meanings that fall into both; I've included these in both lists.


## The verb list

This list is harvested from a now-nonexistent frequency list via [this](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-common-Japanese-verbs/answer/Marcus-Ford) Quora answer.  Where possible, I've linked each verb to its entry in my favourite [Japanese dictionary](https://jisho.org/).

Any given verb will usually be written either with hiragana only, if it's a very common word, or a mix of katakana and hiragana, if it's rarer.  I've put brackets round whichever variant is used less frequently in practice.

I've marked godan "ru" verbs - the fourth conjugation type I mentioned above, which exists just to annoy me - with "godan(!)".  Sadly irregularities like this [tend to correlate](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06137) with how frequently a word is used, so they're massively over-represented in the list below.  This is why we can't have nice things, people!

Currently I'm up to verb 30 of the full list.  I'll sweep up the rest later, as well as adding notes on more of the hinkier verbs.

### Action verbs

I need to:

* Add per-word links to the verb conjugator site.
* Check to see if any others qualify for the "...plus a big pile of other meanings" note.
* Sort out the column widths - are these proportional to the number of hyphens?  If so, does each hyphen add a pixel count or a fraction of the whole?


[^1] It's a roundhouse kick to the noggin, [FYI](https://blackbeltwiki.com/karate-terminology).  You learn something new every day... unless you get kicked in the head, in which case you probably lose a few things.

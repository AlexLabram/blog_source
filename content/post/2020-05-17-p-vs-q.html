<p>I have a lot of respect for the UK actuarial exams, and in some ways that respect has actually increased since I gave up on them a few years back.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking: the earlier actuarial exams get you up to speed with a bunch of essential technical topics, whilst the later exams teach you how to apply those topics without falling into any of a few hundred known pitfalls. Using one highly regarded <a href="https://www.dmingwithcharisma.com/2011/10/dd-stats-in-simple-language/">framework</a> for skills analysis, the earlier exams can be viewed as buffing your INT score, with the later exams focusing on WIS. It’s a healthy mix.</p>
<p>If I had one complaint, though, it’s that the Profession doesn’t really explain this distinction to students, leaving them to deduce the purpose behind each exam for themselves. So the student population tends to segment itself into three groups: those who are intelligent and good at reading the tea leaves, those who are intelligent but need things spelled out, and those who aren’t necessarily so intelligent but are willing to jump through hoops. The first group does well with the exams, the third group does OK, but the second group - including yours truly<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> - tends to crash and burn.</p>
<p>Taking a practical example, I recall that the Business Economics exam (formerly CT7) required one to memorise and regurgitate the various ways that a government could affect the economy. The three channels that candidates had to identify under exam conditions were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Monetary policy</li>
<li>Fiscal policy</li>
<li>Other policies</li>
</ol>
<p>As smarter students tended to notice, one of these things is not like the others…</p>
<p>Now, if you dig deep enough, there are legitimate reasons why you’d come up with a list like this (two <em>real</em> points plus a catch-all). Maybe there’s a long tail of other policy types, which actuaries don’t typically need to be aware of; they only need to know that, whilst monetary and fiscal policy have the most significant effects, they’re not the only players in the game. Given that thought process, the list would actually make sense.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the actuarial exam materials don’t always give you the context behind the content; often you just have to memorise it. Speaking personally, I’ve found that I’m constitutionally incapable<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> of remembering something unless I can see the purpose of it. That attitude works rather well for mathematics - I remember a uni tutor commenting that I had an exceptional grasp of proof - but very very poorly for tasks requiring me to perform rote memorisation without angsting over the “why” of the situation.</p>
<div id="measure-for-measure" class="section level2">
<h2>Measure for Measure</h2>
<p>One slightly more complicated example of this was in the Financial Economics exam (formerly CT8), which acted as a rough-and-ready introduction to the maths used by quants. The core reading material introduced us to the concept of an “arbitrage-free” or “risk-neutral” probability distribution<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Taking the example that absolutely <em>everyone</em> uses to explain this, imagine you’re the bookie at a horse race. You’ve had a word with all the jockeys and you think that the odds for Graceful Lad are 1 to 3 (i.e. a 25% chance of winning). This is what we call a real-world probability.</p>
<p>However, after taking bets from a few punters, you find that they’re a lot less optimistic. For every £10 of bet you receive, only £1 is on Graceful Lad (odds of 1 to 9).</p>
<p>Now at this point there are two approaches you can take. Firstly, you can stick to your guns: keep requiring people to bet £1 plus a small premium for every £3 they want to win. Alternatively, you can go with the flow: change your odds to match the “market rate” of £9 winnings for every £1+premium bet. (You would of course adjust the odds for the other horses similarly.)</p>
<p>Making some simplifying assumptions around the range of betting options available… in the first case, your loss is: (% betting on Gallant Lad) * P(Gallant Lad wins) * (winning payout) + (% betting against Gallant Lad) * P(Gallant Lad loses) * (losing payout) - premium = 0.1 * 0.25 * (3+1) + 0.9 * 0.75 * (1/3 + 1) - premium = £1 - premium per pound of bet.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you charge a market rate, your loss is: (% betting on Gallant Lad) * P(Gallant Lad wins) * (winning payout) + (% betting against Gallant Lad) * P(Gallant Lad loses) * (losing payout) - premium = 0.1 * 0.25 * (9+1) + 0.9 * 0.75 * (1/9 + 1) - premium = £1 - premium per pound of bet. That sounds familiar…</p>
<p>In both cases, your expected profit is on average equal to the premium you charge for betting, since the payout on any outcome is inversely proportional to one of the other numbers: either the real-world probability of an outcome or the proportion of punters taking a position. Where things get stickier, though, is in the volatility of your profit.</p>
<p>In the first case, ignoring the constant premium, the variance (calculated as E(X<sup>2</sup>)-E(X)<sup>2</sup>) is: 0.25 * (0.1 * 4)<sup>2</sup> + 0.75 * (0.9 * 4/3)<sup>2</sup> - 1<sup>2</sup> = 4/100 + 27/25 - 1 = 0.12. In the second case, though, the variance is: 0.25 * (0.1 * 10)<sup>2</sup> + 0.75 * (0.9 * 10/9)<sup>2</sup> - 1 = 0.25 + 0.75 - 1 = 0.</p>
<p>By taking our odds from the punters, rather than from our own best judgement, we have therefore ensured that the house always wins: regardless of what happens in the real world, we make a small risk-free profit. This is the “risk-neutral” probability measure, often referred to as “Q” to distinguish it from the “P” of real-world probability.</p>
</div>
<div id="but-what-does-it-mean" class="section level2">
<h2>But what does it <em>mean</em>?</h2>
<p>Obviously most actuaries or quants don’t work for bookies. For us, the risk-neutral basis is something you use to value derivatives such as put or call options on stocks, for risk management or accounting purposes. In other words, and ignoring discounting etc, the value of a derivative is E<sub>Q</sub>(payout) rather than the more intuitive E<sub>P</sub>(payout). Q can be calibrated based on the market prices for various options on the same underlying stock.</p>
<p>The main theoretical justification given for this valuation approach is that risk-neutral valuations are “arbitrage-free”: since you’re taking your probabilities from the market (which is assumed to have already reached some sort of consensus), no-one can expect to make their own risk-free profit off you by selling you a derivative and then buying instruments with the same payout elsewhere<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. In a world where (to quote Keynes) the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay in the game, this seems more sensible than rolling your own probabilities.</p>
<p>In that context, risk-neutral valuation is an incredibly powerful idea that underlies a lot of modern finance. Given this, I was slightly surprised by how hard it was to get an intuitive explanation of what Q actually represents. In the actuarial study materials, it’s treated purely as an abstract mathematical fiction, like using the square root of minus one in physics calculations. Neither the tutorial I went to nor the rather large amount of googling I did shed any light on the subject.</p>
<p>Again, this kind of comprehension gap was entirely ubiquitous in the actuarial exams. In the case of CT8 this was fortunately the only major difficulty I had, so I was able to get over it and ace the exam. But I kept coming back to the question in the following years. Most recently I have found the distinction relevant to the study of credit risk<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, wherein portfolio loss calculations tend to be on a real-world P basis but credit derivative calculations tend to be on a risk-neutral Q basis.</p>
</div>
<div id="ceci-nest-pas-une-probabilité" class="section level2">
<h2>Ceci n’est pas une probabilité</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there <em>is</em> an intuitive answer. First, though, it’s helpful to try to figure out under what circumstances the real-world and risk-neutral bases would give identical results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If every market participant had the same assessment of the real-world probability of each outcome, and if all the market participants were speculators following a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_(game_theory)#Pure_and_mixed_strategies">mixed strategy</a>, then the real-world and risk-neutral measures would be identical.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why does this not happen?</p>
<p>Primarily it’s because, in the real world, market participants are a lot more diverse than this. Some are arbitrageurs, attempting to exploit differences between market-makers’ prices. Some are hedgers, trying to minimise a company’s overall risk. Many are institutional investors, seeking to maximise profit within a risk-appetite envelope. A few are true speculators… but even those are often concerned with the central outcome rather than the full spectrum of possibilities<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. The Q measure encapsulates all these microeconomic factors so perfectly that valuations specialists rarely need to worry about them.</p>
<p>In short, then: risk-neutral probabilities reflect not the ultimate <em>likelihood</em> of each outcome but the current <em>demand</em> for protection against each outcome and <em>supply</em> of market actors willing to provide that protection. Demand and supply will often be influenced by likelihoods - no-one is providing guarantees against alien invasions, for example - but that’s a second-order effect.</p>
</div>
<div id="vive-la-différence" class="section level2">
<h2>Vive la différence</h2>
<p>Even modellers who aren’t at the sharp end of quantitative techniques need to be mindful of the P vs Q distinction. We regularly need to switch between the two regimes for different purposes: risk management in P, statutory valuation in Q. And sometimes circumstances force us to use “dirty” models containing elements of both, in which case we need to be scrupulously aware of the limitations of our analysis.</p>
<p>More positively, the P/Q divide is a key feature of any attempt to map the terrain of credit risk models. Having an intuitive grasp of this concept will make it much easier to understand the field. I’ll give a broad-brush overview of this area in a future post.</p>
<p>Putting our risk management hats on, another advantage of understanding the Q measure as more than a mere mathematical curiosity is that it gives us a better sense of when it might fall apart. The Q measure makes sense when our employer is a small player in a liquid market with well-defined prices and low transaction costs. If these assumptions start to break down, we may need to rethink. Modern accounting practices are well aware of this<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
<p>On a less immediately practical note, some of the most interesting recent developments in financial mathematics have ties to this area. For example, the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3116887">rough Heston model</a> of asset prices has received a lot of attention from quants because it has proven effective in both P and Q worlds. I’m somewhat out of my depth in this area - so much so that, to quote Terry Pratchett, the fishes have lights on their noses. But I hope to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1717163">read up</a> and report back in a future blog post.</p>
<p>Finally, I personally have found P vs Q a great metaphor for life in general. Have you ever seen a team underestimate a key risk because they’re under gentle pressure from above to assume everything will go to plan? That’s the P of sensible risk management meeting the Q of social pressure.</p>
<p>As with financial Q, the behaviour of social Q is defined by ultimate payoffs: whether deliberately or as an emergent effect of day-to-day interactions, people on a team will tailor their output to match what the Big Boss will most readily sign off on. I’ve been on both sides of insurance audits before and I often reckon that most of the auditor’s value comes from showing up on the first day, since their mere presence forces the subject’s Q-measure much closer to P.</p>
<p>Applications to other fields such as <a href="https://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2020/05/why-media-in-uk-and-us-has-moved-beyond.html">journalism</a> and <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/3212.html">macroeconomics</a> are left as an exercise to the interested reader. But for those still studying the actuarial exams, one example stands out: the P of subject knowledge vs the Q of exam technique. May you have an easier time with the latter than I did.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>But not <em>limited</em> to yours truly, I hasten to add. I know one very intelligent chap who qualified after a decade of exam failures. And, infamously, one of the most cited actuarial academics of our time never completed the exams (but was later awarded a slightly controversial honorary Fellowship). He wrote a wonderfuly scathing letter on the subject in the UK actuarial <a href="http://theactuary.com/">trade publication</a>… which has since sadly disappeared into the internet black hole. If anyone has a bunch of back-issues from late 2005, let me know!<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I discovered and partly conquered this limitation as a side-effect of learning Japanese kanji symbols, but that’s a recent development. Getting technical for a moment, the problem seems to be a hyperactive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)">regularisation</a> function of the brain, which identifies spurious patterns (e.g. shapes in the clouds) and erases them from my neural network. <br /> <br /> Generally that’s a good thing: for example it’s the reason why I will never get addicted to gambling, because I am fundamentally incapable of mistaking a streak of good fortune for an actual victory. Unfortunately, mnemonics and kanji both trigger the same mental behaviour pattern, so that I could quite tangibly <em>feel</em> my memories of logograms being challenged, rejected and wiped away as fast as I could create them.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Or, technically, a “probability measure”: basically a probability distribution where you haven’t yet decided which outcome you want to predict. So the measure associated with an unbiased dice roll would indicate that each outcome was equally likely, and from that you could determine specific probabilities like the chance of getting an even number being 1 in 2.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>In fact, the derivation of E<sub>Q</sub>(X) taught in the actuarial exams relies on this no-arbitrage assumption: by constructing a continuously-rebalanced replicating portfolio with the same payoff as our derivative, and by assuming that no arbitrage opportunities exist - or, equivalently, that the ultimate payoff perfectly dictates the current price - we can figure out the precise value of assets needed at time zero to perfectly delta-hedge the instrument throughout its lifetime. In the case of European put and call options, this approach gives the celebrated Garman-Kohlhagen valuation formulae.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>That actually led to my writing this post. I was going to blog about the taxonomy of credit risk models, but then realised that I couldn’t do that without first explaining P and Q.<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Nicholas Nassim Taleb complains about this in his book Fooled By Randomness. He recounts an anecdote where a manager struggled to understand why Taleb would short a stock that he thought was most likely to rise in value. The answer: because if it did fall, he thought it would absolutely plummet.<a href="#fnref6">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>For example the IFRS 9 standard for financial instrument accounting includes special provisions for instruments where the underlying equity lacks an active market (section 7.2.12-13), and lists the disappearance of an instrument’s active market as a form of credit impairment event (Appendix A: “credit-impaired financial asset” definition.<a href="#fnref7">↩</a></p></li>

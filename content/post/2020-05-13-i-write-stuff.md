This post is a log of publicly-available content I've produced for third parties.  I'll update it as new stuff lands.

# IFoA DS-MIG

I've written on data science for the [Institute and Faculty of Actuaries](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/), the UK's actuarial professional body, as part of my involvement in their [Data Science Member Interest Group](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/practice-areas/general-insurance/member-interest-groups-migs/data-science-mig) (I'm a workstream lead).  These are aimed at a professional audience, so if you're used to Medium.com-style articles then you may find them a bit turgid, but they hopefully provide a good overview of a few key topics.

The articles I've written so far are:

* [What makes a Data Scientist?](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/news-and-insights/news/what-makes-data-scientist) - a quick conversion course for actuaries wanting to know what the fuss is about.
* [Statistics vs ML](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/news-and-insights/news/statistics-vs-machine-learning) - another "taxonomic" article aiming to highlight the difference between ML frameworks and traditional actuarial statistics.
* [The ML Landscape](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/news-and-insights/news/machine-learning-landscape) - a very high-level overview of the various fields and algorithms falling under the heading of "Machine Learning".
* [Fitting data with XGBoost](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/news-and-insights/news/article-fitting-data-xgboost) - a more technical article laying out everything actuaries would typically need to know about this popular algorithm.

I've got another taxonomic article in the works, which will look at the data science toolchain[^1].


[^1]: This is basically an excuse to (a) explore the very large range of specialists that can credibly refer to themselves as "data scientists", and (b) beat people over the head with the *real* meanings of a few frequently-abused buzzwords like Big Data.
